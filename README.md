# ColourSelector

## A better color selector for JUCE.

The aim is to provide a compatible but more fully-featured ColourSelector that mimics Photoshops' behavior and UX.

Fully customizable via feature flags (just like the JUCE one), so it can be used as a direct drop-in. Only the namespace needs to be changed from ```juce``` to ```reFX```.

Ideally, the JUCE team would just adopt it directly into JUCE.
